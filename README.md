# BSCANE2 Waveforms

The BSCANE2 documentation comes a bit short on describing the behavior of the output signals as well as on the requirements of the input signal `tdo`. This repository contains a FPGA design which captures in detail this behavior and tests the timings of `tdo`.

The description of this primitive in the user-guide UG470 is a touch light:

>  A signal on the TDO input of the primitive passes through an output timing register, where the TDO input to the primitive is registered on the falling edge of TCK as it is passed to the external TDO output pin when a USER instruction is active. The associated primitive's SEL output goes High to indicate which USER1-USER4 instruction is active. The DRCK output provides access to the data register clock generated by the TAP controller. The RESET, UPDATE, SHIFT, and CAPTURE pins represent the decoding of the corresponding state of the boundary scan internal state machine. The TDI port provides access from the external TDI pin of the JTAG TAP in order to shift data into an internal scan chain. The TCK and TMS pins are similarly monitored through the BSCANE2 primitive.
